#### The script will perform a search on Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo, and display the links of the search results.
<br>

#### The script will also open a new tab in your computer's default browser with the search results from Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo.
<br>

#### The script uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the search engines and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML responses and extract the links from the search results. You can modify the script to add or remove search engines or customize the HTTP header used in the requests.

#### MultiSearch is a basic example of how to automate the process of searching multiple search engines and extracting the search results. It is important to note that depending on how you use the script, there may be legal and ethical limitations involved in using search engines and web scraping. It is recommended to check the usage policies of the search engines before using the script for commercial or research purposes.
